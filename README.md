## Setting Up Development Environment

This web application uses `npm` for dependency management and requires NodeJS

  1. Set up the back end, following instructions from 
     [the repository](https://github.com/c3g/fms).

  2. Clone the front-end repository locally and change your directory to it:
     
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:c3g/fms_web.git
     cd fms_web
     ```
     
  3. Install the dependencies in the project folder:

     ```
